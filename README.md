# Piero-music

This music player for mobiles was developed from scratch based on [Angular](https://angular.io). Angular features were used to build an application in less time, using components,
modules, routes and types. [Ionic components](ionicframework.com/docs/components) was also used to design the elements of this application. I also used the open-source 
JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps called [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) which does not require an api-key.
